Implementing word2vec with code from "Deep Learning From Scratch 2 - Chapter 4"

Congratulations to the authors for [winning the Test of Time Award at NeurIPS](https://blog.neurips.cc/2023/12/11/announcing-the-neurips-2023-paper-awards/).
Thanks for the inspiration: even language can be represented as numbers/vectors in the end.

- This repository is for the purpose of sharing and demonstrating the word2vec algorithm to students.
- The code is from "Deep Learning From Scratch 2 - Chapter 4" ("밑바닥부터 시작하는 딥러닝 2" in Korean).
